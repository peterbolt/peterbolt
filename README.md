# Pierre Blot
This is my minimalist personal website built using only plain html, css and javascript.

## How to use it

Each time you load the page, it will load a random wallpaper. 

## Acknowledgements
All the random wallpapers are generated from the unsplash API and the user content from the randomuser.me API !
